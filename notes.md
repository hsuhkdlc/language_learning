* In CMUSphinx phoneme recognition 

#### 2019-01-14 
* how to be different from the current applications 

* Think more
    - do u wanna do this really?
    - how to deal with the people here?

* 不卑不亢才是正道

#### 2019-01-07 
* use keras 

* Dataset 
   - [GMU](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/speech-accent-archive#recordings.zip) 
     + variety of accents 
     + module to generalize the rules <- the differences 

   - CMU pronouncing dictionary

* Module
   - create phonological generalizations
